# AlignAssign

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seasmith/AlignAssign.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seasmith/AlignAssign)

Align the assignment operators within a highlighted area.

Before:
```{r}
a <- 1:5
bbb <- 6:10
c <- letters
```

After:
```{r}
a   <- 1:5
bbb <- 6:10
c   <- letters
```

### What
A very simple aligner for a highlighted region's single caret (`<-`) assignment operators. __It does not "reflow" your code if the alignment breaks the page width__ (it does not do anything like `Ctrl + Shift + /`). This addin also does not treat commented lines differently than uncommented lines. __If there is an assignment operator within a highlighted comment line, then it will either align that operator or align other operators to it.__

### Install
`devtools::install_github("seasmith/AlignAssign")`

### Demos

#### Demo 1
When you highlight the following chunk of code (region) - whether you highlight the entirity or just a portion of the first and last lines - and then run the addin...
```{r}
# This is a commented line
# So is this
a <- 1:5
b <- 6:10
copy_a <- a
# More comments
```

...the result will look like this.
```{r}
# This is a commented line
# So is this
a      <- 1:5
b      <- 6:10
copy_a <- a
# More comments
```

#### Demo 2
Be mindful that highling a chunk of code which has assignment operators within commented lines, like the following, and running the addin...
```{r}
# This is a commented line with an assignment operator <-
a <- 1:5
b <- 6:10
c <- 11:15
# There is an assignment operator <- here, too
```

...will result in this.
```{r}
# This is a commented line with an assignment operator <-
a                                                      <- 1:5
b                                                      <- 6:10
c                                                      <- 11:15
# There is an assignment operator                      <- here, too
```

#### Demo 3
There is also no special handling of assignment operators within a function. So, if you highlighted the entire chunk below and then ran the addin...
```{r}
var1 <- letters
var2 <- as.list(sample(1:26, 26))
names(var2) <- var1[unlist(var2)]
list.pos <- function(name, lst){
    matches <- sapply(name, function(x){
        matched <- which(names(lst) %in% x)

        if(length(matched) == 0) matched <- NA
        matched
    })
    return(matches)
}
positions <- list.pos(c("a", "bbb", "c"), var2)
```

...the result would look like this.
```{r}
var1                                     <- letters
var2                                     <- as.list(sample(1:26, 26))
names(var2)                              <- var1[unlist(var2)]
list.pos                                 <- function(name, lst){
    matches                              <- sapply(name, function(x){
        matched                          <- which(names(lst) %in% x)

        if(length(matched) == 0) matched <- NA
        matched
    })
    return(matches)
}
positions                                <- list.pos(c("a", "bbb", "c"), var2)
```
