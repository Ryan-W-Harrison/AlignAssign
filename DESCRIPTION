Description: A very simple aligner for a highlighted region's single caret
    (<-) assignment operators. It does not "reflow" your code if the alignment
    breaks the page width (it does not do anything like Ctrl + Shift + /). This
    addin also does not treat commented lines differently than uncommented
    lines. If there is an assignment operator within a highlighted comment line,
    then it will either align that operator or align other operators to it.
